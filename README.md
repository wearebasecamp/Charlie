# Charlie
An open source Loom alternative for Mac built in Electron.

## Installation
1. Download the ZIP from [releases](https://github.com/wearebasecamp/Charlie/releases) and unzip. You will then find another zip called "Charlie.zip", unzip this one too, it contains the Mac App file.
2. Drag "Charlie" (or "Charlie.app" if you've got extensions enabled) into your Applications
3. Launch Charlie and accept the permissions for recording your desktop and microphone. You may need to relaunch the app and the screenshots of the windows you can record may not show until you've relaunched (we'll look to add a fix to breaking images in the next version).
4. Once relaunched and all permissions have been granted you can start by recording your entire desktop or selecting "View All" to see all available windows you can record.
5. Select the window you wish to record and Charlie should start recording instantly
6. You can stop the recording at any time by clicking the red button inside of your webcam preview or by clicking "STOP RECORDING" from inside of the app.
7. You will then be prompted to save your recording, if you have Google Drive installed, you can save directly to your Drive folder which will automatically make your recording available online.
